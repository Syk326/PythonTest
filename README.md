# PythonTest
I am using the course [Udacity: Introduction to Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) in order to learn some Python, and am posting sample code that I'm experimenting with. Soon I will begin helping out with a Python project at my job.

## Getting Started
You can follow along by installing the latest version of **Python** [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you have a **text editor** (such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)) where you can write code and save as **.py** files. These files can be run from the command line:
```
python3 arithmetic.py
```

You can also write statements right from the command line:
```python
python3
>>>print(6/2)
3.0
```

## What I've Learned
These are some of the topics I've explored so far:
* Write basic python statements using different variable types
* Print simple numeric calculations from command line
* Run a .py script from command line
* Create functions with docstring and use variables that have been assigned values
* Send arguments to functions and return variables/values
* Take strings and format using pre-built functions
* Use conditionals if/elif/else with and/or/not statements
* Create simple program broken down into multiple functions
* Generate lists and manipulate or print elements using indices
* Use for loops with range and while loops as practice with data structures
* Read and re-factored existing code to be more readable
* Remove duplicates easily using sets
* Import a specific list from another script
* Utilize dictionaries (HashSets) to keep track of keys and values
* Manipulate multiple element lists that act as a value in a dictionary entry
* Use tuples to store immutable values
* Set defaults to arguments in functions that are optional, unless the variable is mutable
* Open and manipulate file info (including read and write)
* Explore the Python Standard Library and import relevant modules to save time on pre-existing functions
* Import objects from a module and rename them for easy-to-read code
* Find useful third-party libraries and install using pip
* Install all third-party packages required for a large program using ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
* Search for answers to code questions online on useful websites
* Find the Philosophy article on Wikipedia starting from any other article
* Read and understand basic HTML in web packages
* Install third-party Python libraries that can store and manipulate HTML (Requests and BeautifulSoup)
* Utilize BeautifulSoup documentation to parse HTML information from a Wikipedia page
* Create a Wikipedia web crawler (in accordance with robots.txt) using standard library and third-party libraries
* Troubleshoot bugs and improve script based on what I want it to do
* Completed [Udacity: Introduction to Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)
