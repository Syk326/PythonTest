# PythonTest
I am using the course [Udacity: Introduction to Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) in order to learn some Python, and am posting sample code that I'm experimenting with. Soon I will begin helping out with a Python project at my job.

## Getting Started
You can follow along by installing the latest version of **Python** [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you have a **text editor** (such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)) where you can write code and save as **.py** files. These files can be run from the command line:
```
python3 arithmetic.py
```

You can also write statements right from the command line:
```python
python3
>>>print(6/2)
3.0
```

## What I've Learned
These are some of the topics I've explored so far:
* Write basic python statements using different variable types
* Print simple numeric calculations from command line
* Run a .py script from command line
* Create functions with docstring and use variables that have been assigned values
* Send arguments to functions and return variables/values
* Take strings and format using pre-built functions
* Use conditionals if/elif/else with and/or/not statements
* Create simple program broken down into multiple functions
* Generate lists and manipulate or print elements using indices
* Used for loops with range and while loops as practice with data structures
* Read and re-factored existing code to be more readable
